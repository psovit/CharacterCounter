## The Problem

There are words and there are characters. Characters make up the words and the words make up our worlds.

But how many times was a specific character used to create a word, a phrase, a sentence, a paragrapgh or a novel?

## Solution:

An application that can count the number of times a character occured in the given string of text:


<b> Character Counter</b>

## Character Counter

Character Counter is a simple application that takes in string input and determines the occurence of characters within the provided text input. It then provides a table value of frequency of the characters occurence and also plots a nice graph to give a visual representation.

The application is available at: https://psovit.shinyapps.io/ddp_assgn/
